## Appendix A: Taxonomic Classification

All taxa reported in Chessie BIBI database were assigned the appropriate Phylum, Subphylum, Class, Subclass, Order, Suborder, Family, Subfamily, Tribe, and Genus when applicable. A portion of the taxa reported were reported under an invalid name according to the ITIS database. These taxa were subsequently changed to the taxonomic name deemed valid by ITIS.
